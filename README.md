Unity Practice2 Create with code 1
Motion control for a player who moves in the x and z axes and shoots cookies xD
Animals spawns randomly from above and right and left
To make the animals disappear, they are fed biscuits. To the foxes with a 1, to the deer with 2 and to the sheep with three. If any of the animals reach the bottom, you have one life left. In each game you have 3 lives. Each cookie that the animal eats adds 5 points. The scoring is not reflected on the screen but on the console.

Life bars are added to the animals, to indicate how many cookies they need to disappear.
